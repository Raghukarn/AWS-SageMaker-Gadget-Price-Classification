# AWS-SageMaker-Gadget-Price-Classification
Gadget Price Classification using AWS SageMaker and model deployment with endpoints

## Project Description:
- This project classifies gadgets into price ranges using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset was processed and trained using AWS SageMaker, with train/test datasets stored in S3 buckets, and the model deployed as an endpoint for inference.
  
## Architecture Overview:
- loading data to S3
- training with SageMaker
- storing the model
- deploying an endpoint
- testing the endpoint
  
## Technologies/Tools Used:
- AWS (S3, SageMaker, SageMaker Endpoints)
- Python (boto3, sklearn, pandas, etc.)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset:
Mention where the dataset came from or its features (e.g., "battery_power", "ram", etc.). If itâ€™s public, include a link.
